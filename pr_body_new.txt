## What
- Stabilized \useTableDailyRecordViewModel.spec.ts\ for CI (Linux/headless) by:
  - \i.stubGlobal('alert', ...)\
  - deterministic async flush via \i.runAllTimersAsync()\ (+ microtask flush if needed)
- Normalized \public/_headers\ formatting (2-space indentation, consolidated under \/*\) to satisfy Netlify header parser.
- Restored test isolation in \itest.setup.ts\ by wiring \clearEnvCache\ and resetting mocked storage state between tests.
- Hardened \^Gudit.final-catches.spec.ts\ localStorage spying to avoid prototype/environment variance.

## Why
- Main branch CI was red due to a CI-only flaky test and Netlify header parsing errors.
- This PR applies a minimal, surgical patch (4 files) to restore stable green status.

## Verification
- \
pm run lint\
- \
pm run typecheck\
- \
pm test src/features/daily/tests/useTableDailyRecordViewModel.spec.ts\
- relevant audit unit test(s) passed locally

## Files changed (4)

> [!NOTE]
> \integration-users\ is expected to fail on PR branches due to main-only constraints; it will run and pass on \main\ after merge.
